 OBJECTIVE OF THE SYSTEM   :--------
 
The foremost aim of the food delivery application is to establish a business. These apps connect the customers with the restaurants, and they can directly place the order on the app. Gone are the days when one had to look for pamphlets of restaurants and make a call for ordering a food item.
The gap has been overcome by the apps, which have helped the new and running restaurants to do so well and get in direct touch with the customers.
The food menus and search for cuisine and food is hassle-free and it goes without saying that everything can be found in one place. The delivery applications have benefitted the customers by bringing them to one place for ordering food.
It also allows the customers to access the entire menu that is available at a restaurant of their choice. The open hours, restaurant data and other important information are also available through the apps. Customers can also look for food that fits well in their budget as the prices of all items are mentioned on the menu.
The app allows the customer to keep a check on the time it will take for the restaurant to deliver their food. From taking and ordering to preparing it in their kitchen, to the delivery boy collecting the item and leaving for the customer’s delivery address ,the app aims at giving out every piece of information .These delivery apps’ purpose is to show the estimated time of arrival of the dispatched item from the restaurant to the customer’s address.
Another major objective of the app is to ensure that the customer can make stress free payment.
They follow a procedure and redirect the customer from the food ordering app to the bank’s page where they can directly make the payment.
However, most apps give an option of cash on delivery, wherein the customer can directly pay the delivery boy when her aches home with the food item.
These delivery apps are helpful to the restaurants as they get direct Ratings and reviews from their clients.
