The open hours, restaurant data and other important information are also available through the apps.

The app allows the customer to keep a check on the time it will take for the restaurant to deliver their food. From taking and ordering to preparing it in their kitchen, to the delivery boy collecting the item and leaving for the customer’s delivery address ,the app aims at giving out every piece of information .These delivery apps’ purpose is to show the estimated time of arrival of the dispatched item from the restaurant to the customer’s address.
Another major objective of the app is to ensure that the customer can make stress free payment.
